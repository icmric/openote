# Changelog

All notable changes to Openote. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) with the caveat that **the file format has its own versioning** (File Format Spec §2) and format compatibility is the promise that matters most here.

## [Unreleased — 0.2.0] · the first public release

### Compatibility promise

From 0.2.0 onward: **notebooks created by any Openote release open in every later release.** Format v1 (the `.onote` container) and op-log v1 (the `.onotebook` directory) freeze at this release; future format changes bump the format version and migrate one-way-forward.

### Added
- **Licence** — the project is now legally open source: AGPL-3.0-or-later (app), Apache-2.0 (`onote_core` — build anything on the format, including closed tools), CC0-1.0 (format spec). DCO sign-off, no CLA.
- **Operation log (sync groundwork)** — every notebook gains a `.onotebook` directory beside it: append-only per-device op logs, content-addressed blobs, device identity with fork-on-conflict. Runs in shadow mode; rebuilding a page from the log alone is verified equal to the container.
- **Finger drawing** — palm rejection is now stylus-conditional instead of absolute; ink is reachable on touch-only tablets. Auto/Always/Never control on the Draw tab.
- **Markdown pipe tables render** — GFM tables pasted as text display as real tables (alignment, escaped pipes, ragged rows).
- **CI** — analyze/build/test on Windows, macOS and Linux; `cargo test`/`clippy`; a `cargo-deny` job enforcing that the core stays permissively licensed.

### Fixed
- The dead CRDT placeholder layer (`page_docs`, `page_updates`, `fts_pages`) is no longer created or written; `page_mirror` is documented as the authoritative store (spec v0.2).
- A broken git submodule (`onenote-ref`) that dirtied every checkout.

### Changed
- The File Format Spec is corrected to describe what is actually stored, and now states where the format is going (ADR-0006) so third-party implementers aren't surprised.

## [0.1.0] · unreleased baseline

The pre-release walking skeleton: freeform canvas, notebook hierarchy, live-Markdown text, math blocks, pressure ink, images/attachments, tables, code blocks, themes, Markdown/PDF/open-folder export, the reverse-engineered OneNote `.one`/`.onepkg` importer, and the `.onote` SQLite container. Never tagged or distributed; recorded here as the baseline 0.2.0 builds on.
